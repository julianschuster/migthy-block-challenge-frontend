# Mighty Block - Frontend Developer Test

## Exercise:
You need to develop the **frontent** of a single page web-app following the provided mockups (`Login.png`, `SignUp.png` ,`Main.png` and `UploadPopup.png`).
The app consists of a feature limited **"Instagram"** clone, with just the option to upload images with a description text associatted.

### How it Works
- First time you enter the App it should show a signup/signin popup (`Login.png`).
- You create an account by choosing the signup button, and showing the signup popup (`SignUp.png`).
- Once logged in it shows all the current posts made (with its image, description and upload time) arranged chronologically (from newest to oldest) (`Main.png`).
- It should support dynamic pagination of content.
- To create a new post you need to drag the image you want to upload onto the drag area, that will upload the image and show the post popup (`UploadPopup.png`).
- Once you click the *post* button, the new entry will appear in the main page at the top.
- The app should allow posts to be *liked* and should track *likes* amount.
- The app should also implement a search functionallity (for the porpouse of the test the search results could be random).

### Tasks
- You should assume you have all the needed API's.
- Design and implement the required App and all it's states.
- You should mock all data in order to demo your implementation.

#### Bonus Points
- Host it somewhere so we could try it live.
- Dark mode.
- Add an option to buy images using crypto and connect to a smart contract.

### Tools/Tech to use
- Use `git` for version control.
- Any modern frontend framework (bonus if you use `Vue.js`).
- **Any other tech you think it's needed**: You should explain why you choosed that tech, instead of other.

### Delivery
- You should upload the project to a public GitHub repository.
- A *readme.txt* file explaining anything you think is important about your solution (instructions on how to run it, etc).

## What we will evaluate?
- Code tidyness/source code organization
- Functional aspects of the exercise
- If design follows the mockups
- Proficiency on the used tech/tools
